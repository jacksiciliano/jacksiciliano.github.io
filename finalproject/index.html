          Fangraphs.com estimates that each point of WAR that a player accrues is worth $8 million on the open market. Now what is WAR?
      
          WAR stands for Wins Above Replacement and it is meant to calculate how much value a player produces by taking all aspects of the game into account. It combines defense, offense, base-running, and pitching all into one metric. Here is a good breakdown from Fangraphs about the distribution. Scrub	0-1 WAR,
          Role Player	1-2 WAR,
          Solid Starter	2-3 WAR,
          Good Player	3-4 WAR,
          All-Star	4-5 WAR,
          Superstar	5-6 WAR,
          MVP	6+ WAR. So I wanted to see how often these valuations actually line up with on field results and also how they compare to players salaries. I took the last 9 full MLB seasons and compiled the total payroll and total WAR for each playoff team. As you can see on the graph on the right, their is not a major correlation between WAR and payrolls. So why is that? There are a few different possibilites that I will go into below, but the most important one is that distinction about the open market. MLB teams have control of their players for the first six seasons, so many players never even reach the open market. The payrolls will never be accurately reflected by WAR because very few players are actually being paid their true market value.

    While there is not a huge correlation between spending big and making the playoffs, World Series Champions do tend to spend an above average amount. Here's a look at the last ten champions and how much they spent on their roster. I did not include data for 2020 because of the shortened season.

        </div>
        <p class="lg:w-1/2 w-full leading-relaxed text-black-500">A common theme among a lot of these playoff teams is that they have young players making massive contributions early in their careers. MLB players receive the minimum salary for the first three years of their career. If a player has great season while they are being paid very little, it gives the team more flexibility to add players that give them a better chance at the World Series. I have highlighted some of the best young players who have brought their team to great heights since 2015</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">In just in his second season in the big leagues, the 24-year old Bryant led his Chicago Cubs team to their first World Series in 108 years. His breakout rookie season allowed the Cubs to add some great complimentary pieces in the offseason and bolster the bullpen at the trade deadline. The financial flexibility of having an MVP on a minimum contract was instrumental to building a World Series caliber roster.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Judge broke onto the scene in 2017 at 25 years old. He won the Home Run Derby, and led the Yankees to a wildcard spot. The Yankees had a lot of big contracts on the books, some of them much less fruitful than others, so Judge's huge rookie season on the minimum was paramount to their success.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Betts had one of the best seasons in baseball history as 25 year old in his fifth season. The Red Sox had been gearing up for a World Series run the past few years and Betts' breakout propelled them to that goal. They had a young core of position players, headlined by Betts, and the front office shelled out big money for DH JD Martinez. They knew they had to capitalize on the superhuman play of Mookie Betts and they did.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base"> Witt Jr. did everything for the Kansas City Royals in 2024 at the age of 24. It is up there with some of the best seasons at the Shortstop position of all time. The Royals were not a hugely talented roster in 2024, so their success was surprising. The starting rotation had promise but they lacked depth in the bullpen and lineup. All that to say that beyond the incredible numbers, Bobby Witt Jr. carried a mediocre roster to the playoffs and even won a series.

      Some teams are able to consistently reach the playoffs and compete for their divisions despite playing in smaller markets with lower payrolls. On how they do it, Jonah Soos, president of Syracuse's Baseball Analytics club, says “Defense and their pitching. Most of these teams can cut it and you have to cut it in this market when you're going against Steve Cohen and billions and billions of dollars and being able to pay Juan Soto $765 million. You need to be good at something, and for a lot of these teams it's developing talent”. Click on each team to find out more about their philosophy and how they succeed.

          Just like a baseball game, I'll finish this article off with the bullpen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relievers are the most volatile position group in baseball in terms of year to year performance. 
          “These relievers, you have no idea what they're gonna do in two years. For a player like Juan Soto, you can feel pretty confident in the player he's going to be in 10 years. For the relievers, it's like I hope Kenley Jansen's good this year and I really don't wanna take a risk on having him for three years to save some money because that third year he may be awful", Soos explained.
         
        </p>
        <p>
          Having an elite bullpen is a vital part of a championship team, but it is nearly impossible to who know will step up in the playoffs. Aroldis Chapman has been one of the best closers in baseball history, but his legacy is watered down by a few massive hits in the playoffs(Jose Altuve in 2019 and Rajai Davis in 2016 are the most notable). Emmanuel Clase gave up five runs in the 2024 regular season for the Guardians. He gave up eight in eight innings in the playoffs. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing that, it was no surprise that reliever salaries and WAR values were all over the map. When a player is on the field for such a short amount of time, everything they do has a drastic effect on their numbers. Pitching philosophies are changing and so is bullpen strategy, but putting together an elite bullpen is still one of the most difficult parts of competing for the World Series.
